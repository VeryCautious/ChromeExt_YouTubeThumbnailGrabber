# ChromeExt_YouTubeThumbnailGrabber

This is just a modification of an exampleExtension by google. It was my first try and I made it to get thumbnails from YouTube.
If you install it and are just watching a video. You can click on the extension in the trai and click on "Get thumbnail". Then it will open the thumbnail in a new window.
This method depends on the fact that you can use the video-id and put it into the following link "http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/"+videoID+"/maxresdefault.jpg" to get the thumbnail.

If you want to add anything or change it. Feel free to do so :)
